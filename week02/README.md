# Week 2

## Review

### Object Oriented Programming:

 - we use **classes** to represent _types_ of things, "encapsulated" in neat packages
 - **objects** are the actual things themselves
 - classes can **inherit** from each other
 - we **declare** the class's functions and variables with a header (.h or .hpp) file - this is like a table of contents
 - we **define** the class functions inside a .cpp file

## Apps

 - **Bouncing Square** make a Square class
 - **Bouncing Squares** make an array of Square objects
 - **Shapes** draw some simple stuff, use colors

## Homework

**Read:**
 - [OOPs!](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/OOPs!.html) << a deeper explanation of what we did in class

**Skim:**
 - [How OF Works](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/how_of_works.html)
 - [Graphics](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/intro_to_graphics.html)

**Sketches:**

1.	Create a simple animation using a class of your own design.  You can use the Square class as a template for your code.  
	Play with color, shape, size, movement, speed, etc.  
	  	- the class you write should contain both an update() and a draw() function  
		- try to use an array

2.  Try to make an interactive app, using mouse movement or keyboard presses.  Don't worry if you get stuck, just go as far as you can.

3.  _Extra_ Check out the examples in the 'examples' folder inside the openFrameworks directory.
