# Week 6

## Example Code

### From in-class code:

- **01_particle_systems** - create particle emitters on mouse click  
- **02_attraction** - simple attraction force, follow the mouse

### To Be Posted Thursday night:
- **03_attraction_repulsion** - create a grid of Movers, apply attraction and repulsion based on mouse
- **04_attractors** - create Attractor class, model gravity (see [Reading](#gravity))
- **05_elastic** - create an elastic force, particles spring back to starting point

## Homework

### Reading: The Nature of Code

- <a name=gravity>**[The Nature of Code: Chapter 2 Section 9 "Gravitational Attraction"](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-2-forces/#chapter02_section9)**

- **[The Nature of Code: Chapter 4 "Particle Systems"](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-4-particle-systems/)**

    Remember that **The Nature of Code** is written in the Processing language (Java), but the concepts of physics-based animation are easily translated to C++/oF.


### Sketches

1. **Firework Display** 

    Using **particle systems**, create a sketch that makes colorful firework-like explosions.  The "explosions" should be composed of **_particles_** that _decay_ over time (and probably are affected by gravity, or other forces)...
    
    **Bonus:** Make an interactive firework *launcher* (for example, angle and force of launch is controlled by mouse - think *Angry Birds*...)

2. **Interstellar**

    Create a "space" scene, taking inspiration from the orbital motion of galaxies, stars, planets, moons, comets, asteroids... (... and black holes? :sweat_smile:)  
    Get creative, and don't feel limited by duplicating the _actual_ laws of physics.  You can modify physics to suit your ideas!
      
    Your objects (e.g. your stars, planets, or asteroids, etc.) should be instances of classes that you design.  They should use **forces** like **_attraction_** and **_repulsion_** (or design your own forces).
    
    Now make it interactive! :innocent:
    
    **Bonus:** Game-ify it!  Think about classic space shooters, like [Asteroids](https://www.kevs3d.co.uk/dev/asteroids/index-debug.html)...
    

## Class Review

Coming Thursday night, sorry!
